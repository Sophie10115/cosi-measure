This folder contains templates, guidance and examples to implement a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis in Open Source Hardware. 
 
The Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a qualitative reliability and risk analysis method for preventive quality assurance.
In a systematic team-based approach FMEA identifies and assesses all possible kind of failure modes, 
their causes and effects that can occur.
The result is a prioritized table of possible risks with defined corrective actions.
