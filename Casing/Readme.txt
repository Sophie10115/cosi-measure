You can use the SVG files to laser cut all casing components. 

We have used transparent Acrylic glass and glued the individual components together using Acrifix. 

A more detailed documentation on the assembly of the casing is in preparation. 



Known issues:
- in the svg file of the front cover a hole is missing of the power socket (exporting bug FreeCAD?)
